                There's a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that's where I'll always be.
                Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again.
                Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on.<br />

                Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.
                These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.
                Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
                If you have a problem and no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.<br />

                I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty.
                It's true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch.
                But when I end up in the hay it's only hay, hey hey. I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine.
                'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so fine.<br />
